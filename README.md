# TakeHomeAssignment-jc
Interview Assignment for JumpCloud
Contains a small library function to add actions as well as get stats on added actions.

# Requirements
Windows 10  
[Visual Studio Community 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or newer  
[.NET 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

# Building
Clone the repo from GitHub  
Open the TakeHomeAssignment-jc.sln file in Visual Studio  
Build the solution using the ctrl+shift+B keybind

# Assumptions Made
I made the assumption that a "time" value could not be negative  
I also assumed that more actions that just "run" and "jump" could be added.

# Testing
All tests are executed by running the program in Visual Studio  
To test the functions, I wrote the `Tests.cs` file to ensure that different functionality was working.  
The tests cover the given scenarios in the assignment, plus others that I thought were useful to test.
